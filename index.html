                                Alexandra Kollontai (1872-1952) was the only in Lenin's government,
                                and one of the most famous women in Russian history. She was a
                                revolutionary who saw the revolution become less than she had dreamed,
                                and throughout her life she passionately defend its true ideals.
                                She believed too that real political change could only come with
                                a transformation in personal and family relationships. 
                                Her life, both personally and politically, was stormy. Born into the
                                aristocracy, she became involved early in radical circles, and her
                                lifelong preoccupation with women's emancipation began with her painful
                                decision to leave her husband and child. She worked tirelessly all her
                                life, a brilliant speaker, writer and orginiser, and her ideas are 
                                crucial today as they were in her own time. </p>

                                Kollontai is known for her advocacy of free love.
                                However, this does not mean that she advocated casual sexual
                                encounters; indeed, she believed that due to the inequality
                                between men and women that persisted under socialism, such encounters 
                                would lead to women being exploited, and being left to raise children alone.
                                Instead she believed that true socialism could not be achieved 
                                without a radical change in attitudes to sexuality, 
                                so that it might be freed from the oppressive norms that
                                she saw as a continuation of bourgeois ideas about property.
                                A common myth describes her as a proponent of the "glass of water"
                                theory of sexuality. The quote "...the satisfaction of one's sexual
                                desires should be as simple as getting a glass of water"
                                is often mistakenly attributed to her.
                                This is likely a distortion of the moment in her short story 
                                "Three Generations" when a young female Komsomol member argues that sex 
                                "is as meaningless as drinking a glass of vodka [or water, depending on
                                the translation] to quench one's thirst." In number 18 of her Theses
                                on Communist Morality in the Sphere of Marital Relations, Kollontai argued that
                                "...sexuality is a human instinct as natural as hunger or thirst."
                                Kollontai's views on the role of marriage and the family under Communism 
                                were arguably more influential on today's society than her advocacy of "free love." 
                                Kollontai believed that, like the state, the family unit would wither away once the
                                second stage of communism became a reality. She viewed marriage and traditional
                                families as legacies of the oppressive, property-rights-based, egoist past. Under
                                Communism, both men and women would work for, and be supported by, society, not
                                their families. Similarly, their children would be wards of, and reared basically by society
                                Kollontai admonished men and women to discard their nostalgia for traditional family
                                life. "The worker-mother must learn not to differentiate between yours and mine;
                                she must remember that there are only our children, the children of Russia's communist
                                workers." However, she also praised maternal attachment: "Communist society will
                                take upon itself all the duties involved in the education of the child, but the joys
                                of parenthood will not be taken away from those who are capable of appreciating them."
